## What's Cookin'

A front-end project by Taylor Johnson, Nicole Gooden, and Caleb Cyphers.

### Project Overview

This project is meant to present the user with a display of recipes, from which the user can choose to favorite recipes, add to the upcoming recipes section, or view the recipe information popup that details the total cost of ingredients, required ingredients, and instructions.  A search feature has been implemented so that the user can find desired recipes more quickly, based on ingredient, tag, or name.  The user also has access to its pantry, where pantry item cards are shown with the amount in stock.
